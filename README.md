A microservices-based backend application for a quiz system built using Spring Boot, MySQL, and incorporating service discovery with Eureka Server. Here's a breakdown of the 
architecture and components:

Quiz Backend Application:
Technology Stack: Utilizes Spring Boot for building microservices, MySQL for the database layer, and Eureka Server for service registration and discovery.
Architecture: Follows the microservices architectural pattern, where different components of the application are developed and deployed as independent services.
Services:

1.QuizService: Manages the core functionality of the quiz application, such as user authentication, quiz creation, and scoring. It interacts with other services to 
fetch questions and manage quiz sessions.

2.QuestionService: Responsible for managing questions, including creation, retrieval, and updates. Provides endpoints for CRUD operations on questions.
ApiGateway: Acts as an entry point to the microservices architecture. It routes incoming requests from clients to the appropriate service based on the request path or URL.
The gateway also handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and monitoring.

3.ServiceRegistry (Eureka Server): Provides service registration and discovery capabilities. Each service instance registers itself with the registry upon startup, 
and the registry maintains a dynamic list of available services. Clients, such as the API Gateway or other services, can query the registry to discover available service
instances and route requests accordingly.

Database:
MySQL: Used as the persistent storage backend for storing quiz-related data, including user profiles, quiz configurations, questions, and quiz session information.
Each microservice may have its own database schema or share a common schema depending on the data ownership and access patterns.

Communication:
REST APIs: Services communicate with each other and with clients using RESTful APIs over HTTP. This allows for loose coupling between services and enables them to be developed,
deployed, and scaled independently.
Service-to-Service Communication: Services interact with each other directly through RESTful API calls. For example, the QuizService may call the QuestionService to fetch
questions for a quiz.

Service Discovery: Eureka Server enables service discovery by maintaining a central registry of available services and their instances. Services use Eureka
clients to register themselves with the registry and discover other services by querying the registry.
Deployment:
Containerization: Services are packaged as Docker containers, providing consistency and portability across different environments.
Orchestration: Containerized services are deployed and managed using container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, which handle tasks such as service scaling, load balancing, and service discovery.
Scalability and Resilience:
Horizontal Scaling: Services can be horizontally scaled by running multiple instances to handle increased load and improve fault tolerance.
Fault Tolerance: Services are designed to be resilient to failures. For example, if a service instance becomes unresponsive, Eureka Server and the API Gateway can route requests to healthy instances automatically.
Overall, this architecture promotes flexibility, scalability, and resilience by decomposing the application into smaller, loosely coupled services that can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled.
